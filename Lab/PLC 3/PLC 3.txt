It is required  to design a ladder diagram for a shift register used to control a spray painting operation in a production line (shown in the figure)
 
The production line has a number of fundamental requirements:
- painting takes place only when an object to be painted is present on the rack
- undercoat is applied by spray gun 1
- undercoat is dried in oven 1
- undercoat is applied by spray gun 2
- undercoat is dried in oven 2
 
Notes:
- use a shift register of 16 bits
- each group must present a report of their design (a clear ladder diagram is enough) at the beginning of the lab period

Hints:
1-Assume there is a way to make a shift register in Toshiba which you will know in the lab
2-Assume you can use each bit in the register as a NO or NC switch

There exists the shift register of 16 bits in the lab,it is existing in the manual of the previous year:

Assume there exist the 16 bit shift register of 16 cases.

Assume that there exists an input x1 to the shift register

Assume that there exists an output called s1 representing the state of the shift register
   
Question :
The shift register should have 2 inputs (not one) , one for input data, and the other for the clock..
and about the output, there should be 16 available outputs..
 
Concerning the register output, disgard the drawing (16 outputs) cause it is only one that
outputs at a time 
 
Concerning the second input, it enters to the register from outside or assume that it is an initial condition.
